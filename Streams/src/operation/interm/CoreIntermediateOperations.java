		//flatMap
		/**
		 * The flatMap transforms each element of a stream into another form (just like map), 
		 * and generates sub streams of the newly formed elements. 
		 * Finally, it flattens all of the sub streams into a single stream of elements.
		 * As the flatMap is a map type of function, it also takes a function and applies
		 * (maps) that function to each of the element in the stream. 
		 * 
		 * The difference between map and flatMap is, the map accepts a function
		 * that returns a mapped element and then the map function returns a stream of 
		 * such elements. On the other hand, the flatMap accepts a function that returns 
		 * streams of the mapped elements and then the flatMap finally returns a 
		 * collective stream of all of the sub streams that are created by the each 
		 * execution of the passed function. Let's have a look at the below example,
		 * which clearly shows how the flatMap works and also also shows the difference
		 * between the map and flatMap when passed a similar function.
 
         * We did almost the similar operation with the flatMap, 
		   with the only difference that the function passed to the flatMap returns a stream.
